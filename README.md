Welcome to the EEGResearchHub! This repository serves as a hub for various projects focused on EEG (Electroencephalogram) research. This README is available in the following languages:

- **[English (Current)](./README.md)**
- **[中文](./README_Ch.md)**

The toolbox currently includes two main projects:

1. **EEG Data Augmentation Project**
2. **A Simple EEG Classification Task**

You can find detailed information about each project, including how to set up and use them, in their respective README files (available in both English and Chinese).

## [EEG Data Augmentation Project](./EEG-Data-Augmentation/README_En.md)

- **Languages:** English & 中文 (Chinese)
- **Description:** This project is aimed at augmenting EEG data using various techniques like SVG. It consists of two directories: `config` for electrode position configurations and `tools` for the implementation of augmentation techniques.

## [A Simple EEG Classification Task](./A_Quick_EEG_Classification/README_En.md)

- **Languages:** English & 中文 (Chinese)
- **Description:** A general-purpose EEG neural network training framework. It features a collection of deep neural network architectures for Motor Imagery classification tasks.
